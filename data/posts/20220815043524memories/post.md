theyre always weird, arent they? for instance this one memory from 2016, listening to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8EeDBqyPtk">song</a>. i was listening to it in a graveyard, after midnight, just watching the moon and smoking some blunts. every fall i get a hint of that nostalgic memory, i dont know why. could it be because i was alone and had to deal with nothing? no one to force me to do shit? i was genuinely being me? who knows, all I know is that I want to go back to that, peaceful, moment.<br></br>also! i have found a bug with this blogging system... i cant input certain characters such as apostrophe into it..... oh well time for md files instead of mysql.
