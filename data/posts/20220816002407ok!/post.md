I am satisfied with the backend. Now it's time to work on the frontend, then perhaps the site will reach version ***1.4*** !!

## Coming:

+ Comments (Debating on whether I should do per post comments or not)
+ /Projekts/
+ /Version Browser/
+ /Experiments/
+ /Gallery/
+ Discord Status (Live?)
+ Steam integration
+ Post Editor UI/UX rework
+ Post UI rework

and

+ Some love for the UI

  This isn't simply a blog site <-<
