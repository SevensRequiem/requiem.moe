ive already got 4 mc servers on the machine, an arma server, a couple factorio servers, andddd some gmod servers. ive wanted my own server since i was a kid so yeah, really comfy. oh oh the specs, right,, ***32 cores @ 3.3ghz, and 96gb ram (786gb max)***


anyway hope you all have a good and comfy 2023!
