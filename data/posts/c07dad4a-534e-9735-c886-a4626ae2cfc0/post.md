these new meds are interesting, tho the vanilla taste is weird.. depakote alongside prozac is actively helping me get some of my memories back which is nice! besides the bad memories, especially of snakes (as in people), and ive also been getting rid of some from my life so i can finally move forward!

the chameleon aspect of BPD is still confusing to me, also. i dont even do it consciously, it just happens and i catch myself doing it at a later point. 

ALSOOO apparently ur actually allowed to do what ever you want, cant tell if shit friends, religion from childhood, or shit family, or the combo of them caused that complex, but being 23, and just now figuring that out is... aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. i rlly hate ppl sometimes. depakote has also helped in this regard, i wonder if this complex is apart of either borderline, or bipolar. hmmmmmm...


oh oh oh and i havent been working on ver 1.4 lately! however it should be up by halloween! (i so gotta make a spooky theme)
