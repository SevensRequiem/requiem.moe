    <p>requiem.moe; a place for me to try and express and unlock parts of myself. i'm not that great at anything and i havent really went to school for this stuff buuuut it is a passion of mine, since around 11 years of age,
    i've been interested in web development and design. i've always wanted to make my own website and i've always wanted to make my own game. i've never really had the "time", haha procastination and bedrotting is a Bxtch!!
    some notion of the early web from when i was a kid drives me really.</p>
    <p>As I struggle w BPD and often change personalities mid conversation, this site has helped as sort of a foundation for me to build upon. I've been able to express myself in ways I never thought I could.</p>
    <p>giant middle finger to those whom doubted/belittled me! fuck all yall</p>
    <p>getting out of bed is extremely hard for me yet this site is one of the things that makes me get up and work on little bits at a time</p>
